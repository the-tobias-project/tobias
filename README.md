# Tobias
Tobias (_Tests of bias_) is a suite of exploratory statistical tests for detecting subtle biases in clinical genomics resources. 

Our initial release (version 1) focuses on questions related to genetic ancestry, and whether it confounds the clinical interpretation of a genetic variant. We explore these questions by means of statistical tests on two widely-used, publicly available resources that most clinical laboratories rely on in their interpretation process: ClinVar and EXaC.

#### GUI:
Tobias is accompanied by a web-based frontend to help researchers quickly visualize and explore the space of potential hypotheses (under development)  

#### Usage:
